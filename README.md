# [Etch-a-Sketch!](https://j-boardman.github.io/sketcher)
<p>This project is a simple Etch-a-Sketch app made with vanilla JavaScript, as part of The Odin Project's Basic JavaScript course. Please note the current script file is a revised version, the original (which more accurately reflects my skill at the time) is within the v1 folder.</p>
<p>Project was assigned after learning about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Array Methods</li>
  <li>Loops</li>

 </ul>
